Pyramid
*******
The aim of the game is to progress through each row of the pyramid from bottom to top. 
The player is prompted to select a hidden card from the current row. The player can
progress to the next row up if the card is NOT a face card (see below). If the player
selects a face card, a drink must be consumed, the pyramid is reset, and they must 
start again from the bottom. The player wins if they draw a card from every row while
avoiding any cards with a face value. Enjoy!

Face Cards:
4 x ACE
4 x Jack
4 x Queen
4 x King
