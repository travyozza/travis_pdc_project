Red or Black 
************

The aim of the game is to select the correct colour of the next drawn card from the deck.
The colour of the card is based on the suit. Clubs and Spades are black, while Diamonds and Hearts
are red. The player will be prompted to select whether or not they believe the next card to be
red or black. If they are correct, the player will move on to the next card without consequence.
If they are incorrect, then they will be required to take a sip of their drink. The game continues
until the deck is empty, or if the user taps out. Enjoy! ;)
